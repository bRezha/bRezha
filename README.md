##  👋 About Me

Hi, I'm Rezha Bayu, a beginner Web Developer on a journey to master web development.

I'm currently learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript fundamentals with The Odin Project. My ambition is to become a skilled Full Stack Developer within the next 2 years.

I'm enthusiastic about collaborating on projects and connecting with fellow developers to learn and grow together.🫱🏻‍🫲🏽
